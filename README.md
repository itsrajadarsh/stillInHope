[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live-Demo-brightgreen)](https://stillinhope.onrender.com)

StillInHope is a simple Flask web application where users can report local issues like **potholes** or **roadside garbage**.  
It instantly generates a **certificate PDF** with details (name, location, date/time, disaster type, and photo), shows a **preview image**, and lets users **download & share** the report.
